# ðŸ˜… Engagement

#### Philosophy

When most companies about engagement, they're talking about engagement with the platform. They're talking about the 50 hours spent looking scrolling endlessly without finding what they want. When companies are talking about engagement often times they're talking about longing, about wanting, about needs not getting met; -that's success in their mind. If a person was actually getting their needs met that wouldn't spend so much time looking at their f\*\*\*\*\*\* computer or their smartphone or anything else. What they're actually monitoring for "engagement" is engaging with the advertising, what they really mean is providing more data to sell the different advertisers.&#x20;

We consider engagement and entirely different way, engagement isn't what you do on the app, it's what you do off the app that matters. Successful engagements aren't measured in time spent on app, successful engagements are measured to get time spent with other humans. It's a successful engagement something that needs to be in unity, the contributes to not something not simply spending time just rolling through things doomscrolling not getting your needs back and not finding a way to engage.&#x20;

For us engagement is the process of people coming together over something that they care about, it's a step towards building Community, it's a step towards individual empowerment, it's the things that happen when people get together in real life and be a real and do something that matters to them. Something significant. We don't measure engagements on eyeball hours or with how many things you scroll past, when we speak of Engagement we are speaking of tangible actual things that happened between people. The point of app is not to make us look good to data salesmen or advertisers.  Our app is nothing more than scaffolding to enable people to connect who otherwise wouldn't. To help people meet their goals to fulfill their ikigai to do something out in the world. The only engagements that we count, the only engagements that matter are the successful engagements between members of the EVR Community.
