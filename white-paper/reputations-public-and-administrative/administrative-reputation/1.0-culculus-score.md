# 1.0 Culculus score

#### Philosophy

“Cuculus cuckoos are brood parasites, that is, they lay a single egg in the nests of various passerine hosts. The best-known example is the European common cuckoo. The female cuckoo in each case replaces one of the host's eggs with one of her own. The cuckoo egg hatches earlier than the host's, and the chick grows faster; in most cases the cuckoo chick evicts the eggs or young of the host species.” -wikipedia

The cuculus score functions as a barrier for content created in bad-faith, taste, or judgment,
