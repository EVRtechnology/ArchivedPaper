# üôÅ demurrage

#### Philosophy

Nothing is permanent, who you are today wont be who you are tomorrow. If you don't look back on the person you were 5 years ago and cringe... you're doing something wrong.&#x20;

We develop skills along the way,&#x20;

Just as tangible skillsets develop of diminish over time, so too our preferences, our opinions,&#x20;

We all need the space to grow, and time provides that,&#x20;

Held accountable without being held back.
