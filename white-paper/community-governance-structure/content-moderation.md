# ðŸ˜… Content Moderation

#### Philosophy

While we strongly believe that the structure and purpose of the platform render it a subprime target for spammers, trolls, and provocateurs; it's a virtual guarantee that questionable content will make it onto the site.

We anticipate that, whether through ignorance or malice, individual lapses in judgement will occur. But we also anticipate that, on the whole, the disposition and sensibility of our aggregate member base will remain sound.  Therefore, instead of moderator farms, we crowdsource our content moderation.

Rather than trying to shield our members from unpleasantness, we grant them the ability to confront it directly.

Happily, those same mechanisms put in place for content moderation can be used for decision-making generally on the platform. \[more to say on this later in next version]

#### Examples

MOST would agree that its NOT okay to "kick puppies"

A permaculture guild can decide FOR ITSELF whether "carving lawn gnomes" is a relevant activity.

MOST can identify inquiries about "your car's extended warranty" as dubious.&#x20;
