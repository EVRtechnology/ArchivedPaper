# ðŸ˜‰ Preface to a Gitbook

Overview

A repository for all things related to the development of EVR; that they may be shared with interested/ invested parties, and referenced by those working on the project itself. To be clear, this is not (as-of-yet) a public document. Your invitation here is the result of a conscious choice, meaning that in some capacity: we want you to be a part of this. &#x20;

#### What's here & why

We begin with a bit of world building: The narrative that drives what we are doing, our assumptions, intentions, and what we see as the future of this endeavor.  We want to be explicit about our vision, and the role the EVR Team plays in seeing it through.&#x20;

Toolkit introduces our key offerings: the specific MacroTools being build to meet those ends, what each is meant to accomplish, and the board strokes of how. While heavy on the exposition, the aim is to firmly establish the context that necessitates each tool.&#x20;

The world of EVR:  touches on the benefits for individual/organic users, and applications & industry focuses on the institutional adoption, benefits, & use. We've done our best to outline both immediate and emergent consequences.

Blue & White papers get into the specifics of how those tools are constructed (from a high-level-design perspective); outlining the component pieces of each MarcoTool and how they play into the over all architecture of the app, as well as the philosophy behind the inclusion necessity of each. Philosophy is addressed in the White paper, Architecture in the Blue.

#### How best to approach the work

Skimmed, rifled, or read cover-to-cover; which ever way suits your style of discovery. The document has been constructed as a wiki with an arc: Plenty of cross links, but an attempt has been make it an enjoyable read.&#x20;

To be clear, this draft is still incomplete to varying degrees. -A good many things have yet to be imported or linked, and a number of pages are missing outright. But I would be remiss if my But ever onward.a prefix of 2.0 would indicate 1.0 = good enough to get the point across, 0.9 = Oh my, that's.. ah.. real-rough. 0.0 =  I draft. not (as-of-yet) a completed document:&#x20;
