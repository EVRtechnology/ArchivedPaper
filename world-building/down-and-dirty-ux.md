# üòÖ Down and Dirty UX

### Sticking to the basics

On the surface, Evr presents the same functionalities that we've become accustomed to in a social networking/ media app. Members make their profiles, search for, create, & share "content" with one another. In this way we land very close to the tried-and-true models of UI, so there isn't much of a learning curve. **There is nothing unique in what we are expecting/asking of our \[customers]**, the difference is in what they can expect in return from their efforts, with the devil exorcised from the details.

### SEPERATE this out into UX & facets of the tools

### Opportunities

We do not peddle in memes or microblogs, promote doom scrolling or passive entertainment. Instead, members of the EVR App search for Opportunities to connect and engage with one another over what they love. -A formula the sandbox of the internet hasn't yet been able to provide. Coordinated via agreed upon time place participant & activity.&#x20;

Bridging the gap between where we are now and where we want to be doesn't require us to build a better mousetrap, or reinvent the wheel; our technical capacity is sufficient, and the desire is ubiquitous.  is the novel application of well-known principals to already existing technologies.&#x20;

The challenge is to enable capacities we already have at the technological & personal level.

### Reputation

Through the course of engaging in these pursuits members earn Reputation, which is the cornerstone of our platform. These public reputations are sourced, aggregated, and shared via our Social Recognition Software; to relay the Nature, Aptitude, & Communication skills a person has exhibited within the EVR community. By this means Members provide one another with both validation & accountability. This promotes good-faith interactions & incentives pro-social behaviors in the interim, upon which trust, reciprocity, and belonging can be built promotes good-faith interactions & incentives pro-social behaviors

### Guilds

The scaffolding that people use to navigate these opportunities is our Guild-structure, something like a phylogenetic tree of human-endeavors.

Guilds are fractal, self organized, and self regulating collectives of members who share a common pursuit. Opportunities posted to a guild page may be for calls for collaboration, mentorship, apprenticeship, training, action, or anything pertinent to that guild‚Äôs mission.

Guild members themselves determine what is appropriate for their boards, and membership is earned through participating in that Guild‚Äôs opportunities

### Governance

The quality control mechanisms that maintain the health and veracity of content on the platform are stewarded by members of the app itself. Decisions are made and conflicts resolved by these same means.

instigate or contest any decision making process, 3^0 (one person) &#x20;

determinations are by 2/3 supermajority, 3^1  (3 )(3^2 (9) 3^3 (27) &#x20;













EVR operates without the ‚Äúneed‚Äù for bureaucracy intervention, or external oversight; providing instead the protocols for our membership base to retain sovereign stewardship of their spaces and affairs.&#x20;

Decisions are made by relevant stakeholders. via 2/3 super majority



















anything less would run counter to the necessity autopoiesis (the capacity of living cells to reproduce and organize themselves) is at the heart of&#x20;

&#x20;

Limited in scope to relevant stakeholders as related through guild affiliation.&#x20;



### How it happens (SUPER basics of rep & guild)

People get together, they build reputation, create community, mechanics.&#x20;
