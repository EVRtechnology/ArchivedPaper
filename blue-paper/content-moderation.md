# ðŸ˜… Content Moderation

#### Overview

Whenever a Member identifies a piece of content they find troubling or inappropriate, they present it as a Dilemma to some portion of the greater  EVR Community, who are empowered to remove content as they see fit.

<mark style="color:red;">\[There is FAR too much here, this needs to be broken up into more digestible pages]</mark>

As we've identified it, the moderation proceeds along 7 stages: Instigation -> Discovery -> Assessment -> Formalization -> Docketing -> Arbitration -> Consequence.

Each stage along the way is subject to influence in at least one of 3 ways:&#x20;

Proactively - via the PotenzaIndex & BillingsScore

Responsively - via the ArbitrationThreshold,  ArbitratorPool, and basic self selection

and Reactively -via Arbitration & subsequent adjustments made to the metrics listed above

The direct outcomes of content moderation can result in removal of content and/or censure of Members. But the implications are greater, and the repercussions far further reaching than that.&#x20;

While content moderation may not be a flashy selling point, or clever marketing tool, it is paramount to the safety, utility, usability, and enjoyability of the platform, as well as the amenability & disposition of those on the platform.&#x20;

The choice of moderation process has the uniquely direct influence of making the platform favorable to philanthropic attitudes/endeavors, and inhospitable to misanthropic ones.&#x20;

As we've identified it, Moderation takes place along 7 stages, and can be characterized in 3 ways Proactive, Responsive, & Reactive.&#x20;

Those stages are: Instigation -> Discovery -> Assessment -> Formalization -> Docketing -> Arbitration -> Consequence.

The 3 characteristics are Proactive, Responsive, & Reactive.

Proactive - PotenzaIndex & BillingsScore

Responsive -ArbitrationThreshold & ArbitratorPool

Reactive -Arbitration, Adjustments made to any of the metrics listed above

1\) Instigation: A piece of content is generated & posted.

2\) Discovery: Viewing the content elicits a negative reaction from a Member. &#x20;

3\) Assessment: The Member must gauge the strength and nature of their reaction, and whether it merits action on the part of others. \[<mark style="color:red;">are we thinking that people can just block those they don't like, how do we manage the line between sticking around to regulate & inundating with drivel?</mark>]

4\) Formalization: The Member must communicate the grounds on which the content is being challenged (either that it is Unethical, or Unfitting), and justify their assertion (in the form of a Brief)

5\) Docketing: Given that the Arbitration Threshold is met; a redacted version of the content in question along with its Brief <mark style="color:red;">\[do we include here the option to see previous briefs is the content has been called into question more than once]</mark>, is sent for arbitration.

6\) Arbitration: a determination is made about the disputed content.

7\) Consequences:  can result in either:

Removal of the content, and a lowering of the PotenzaIndex of the Member(s) who posted it

Non-removal of the content, and a lowering of the BillingsScore of the Member(s) who disputed the content.&#x20;

Absolution (re-posting) of previously removed content, and adjustments (proportional reversal) to the BillingsScore(s) & PotenzaIndex(s) of those affected. &#x20;

In any case the Arbitration Threshold of the disputed content is raised, and its docket saved administratively, not publicly (primarily to prevent members from being recalled to arbitrate over the same piece of content, but also for statistical & edification purposes.



#### Where it occurs/ how we initiate it

Whenever a Member identifies a piece of content they find troubling or inappropriate, they present it as a dilemma to some portion of the greater  EVR Community.
