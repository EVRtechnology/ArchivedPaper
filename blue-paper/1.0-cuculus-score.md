# 1.0 Cuculus score

#### Overview

Culcus scores are added together to meet the Potenza Threshold (needed to post content)

The baseline for a culcus is set at 1 (as is the Potenza threshold)

For every piece of content that is removed through Arbitration, the culcus score of the posting member (and any cosigning members) is lowered by 66%

Culcus Scores return to their baseline through a process of appreciation over time, and increase at a rate of + 22% for each successful engagement.

It is important to note that culcus scores only apply to the posting of content. These scores IN NO WAY affect the ability of a member to participate in arbitration processes, respond to or engage in opportunities with others in the EVR community.

Billing scores are an aspect of an individual's account. Not for public display/ disclosure. Does not affect voting rights or lotocracy process, is independent of each. Depreciates at what rate? 4 years later returns to zero?
